Getting started:

In both the client and server directory,

run the command 'npm start' in the terminal.

Both must be running in order for the app to work properly.

If running npm start does not open your browser and go to the site automatically, in your browser enter the url: 'localhost:3000'.

Using the app:

There are three pages to navigate between: Create user, create post, and view posts. Navigate between the pages by clicking the links near the top.

Create user: On the create user page, enter any characters in the username, password, and favorite animal fields. When your user is ready, click the submit button to create user.

Create post: On the create post page, select your desired user from the dropdown menu, and enter any characters in the title and entry fields. When your post is ready, click the submit button to create the post.

View post: The view post page is exclusively for viewing posts. There is no additional functionality.
